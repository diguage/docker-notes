== Docker Engine

. a daemon process (the `dockerd` command)
. A REST API
. A command line interface (CLI) client (the `docker` command).

The daemon creates and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

== What can I use Docker for?

. Fast, consistent delivery of your applications
. Responsive deployment and scaling
. Running more workloads on the same hardware

== Docker Architecture

=== The Docker daemon

. listens for Docker API requests
. manages Docker objects

=== The Docker client

The `docker` command uses the Docker API. 

=== Docker registries

A Docker _registry_ stores Docker images.

Docker Hub is a public registry.

=== Docker objects

. image
. container
. network
. volume
. plugin
. other objects

==== IMAGES

An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. 

==== CONTAINERS

A container is a runnable instance of an image.

==== Example

`docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash` 

. Docker pulls the `ubuntu` image from your configured registry, `docker pull ubuntu`;
. Docker creates a new container, `docker container create`;
. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. 
. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network
. Docker starts the container and executes `/bin/bash`.
. type `exit` to terminate the `/bin/bash` command, the container stops but is not removed.

==== SERVICES

Services allow you to scale containers across multiple Docker daemons, which all work together as a swarm with multiple managers and workers.

== The underlying technology

=== Namespaces

Docker uses a technology called `namespaces` to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 

. The `pid` namespace: Process isolation (PID: Process ID).
. The `net` namespace: Managing network interfaces (NET: Networking).
. The `ipc` namespace: Managing access to IPC resources (IPC: InterProcess Communication).
. The `mnt` namespace: Managing filesystem mount points (MNT: Mount).
. The `uts` namespace: Isolating kernel and version identifiers. (UTS: Unix Timesharing System).

=== Control groups

A control group (`cgroup`) limits an application to a specific set of resources. 

=== Union file systems

Union file systems, or UnionFS, are file systems that operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast.

Docker Engine can use multiple UnionFS variants, including AUFS, btrfs, vfs, and DeviceMapper.

=== Container format

Docker Engine combines the namespaces, control groups, and UnionFS into a wrapper called a container format. The default container format is `libcontainer`.
